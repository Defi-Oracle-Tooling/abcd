Post-deployment tasks should include:

## Monitoring
- Active and passive monitoring
- Full detailed logging

## Issue Management
- Updated recommendations to solve issues before they become errors
- Rapid error handling

## Data Management
- Full data protection
- Proper data backup

## Upgrades and Additions
- Fully integrated upgrading

- Support for multi-tenant deployments

## Support for Multi-Tenant Deployments
- Ensure proper isolation of tenant data and resources to maintain security and privacy.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage tenant-specific permissions.
- Optimize resource allocation to prevent performance degradation due to tenant resource contention.
- Provide scalability options to accommodate varying tenant workloads.
- Include monitoring and logging mechanisms to track tenant-specific activities and ensure compliance.
- Support customization for tenants, such as configurable deployment options or plugins.
- Adhere to relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001) to ensure tenant data protection.

### Additional Details
- **Isolation Techniques**: Use Kubernetes namespaces or dedicated virtual machines for tenant isolation.
- **RBAC Tools**: Leverage tools like Keycloak or AWS IAM for managing tenant-specific roles and permissions.
- **Resource Optimization**: Implement auto-scaling policies and resource quotas to ensure fair resource distribution.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use Prometheus and Grafana to track tenant-specific metrics and logs.
