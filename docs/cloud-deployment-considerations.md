# Cloud Deployment Considerations

Cloud deployments should support:

## Infrastructure Types
- Virtual machines (VMs)
- Virtual machine scale sets
- Containers
- Container clusters (e.g., Kubernetes)
- Other cloud-specific offerings:
  - **AWS Outposts**: Extend AWS infrastructure to on-premises environments.
  - **Azure Arc**: Manage hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
  - **Google Anthos**: Enable consistent Kubernetes management across cloud providers.
  - **IBM Cloud Satellite**: Deploy and manage applications across any environment.

## Security and Monitoring
- Real-time API and CLI automated interactions to retrieve current quotas and test deployability
- Implementation or review of:
  - "Clouds for Industry"
  - "Well-Architected Designs"
