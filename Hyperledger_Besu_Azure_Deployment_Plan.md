# Hyperledger Besu Azure Deployment Plan

For deploying Hyperledger Besu nodes on Azure, the choice of instance depends on the specific role of the node in the network. Here's a breakdown of the best Azure instance families for each node type:

### **1. Boot Node**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard Bsv2 Family**
- **Reason**: Boot nodes primarily handle peer discovery and require moderate compute and memory resources. Standard Bsv2 instances are cost-effective and suitable for this role.

### **2. Public Member Node**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard ESv5 Family**
- **Reason**: Public member nodes need higher compute and memory for handling transactions and maintaining the blockchain state. ESv5 instances provide enhanced performance for such tasks.

### **3. Admin Member Node**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard Ev5 Family**
- **Reason**: Admin nodes often require robust compute and memory resources for managing permissions and overseeing network operations. Ev5 instances are optimized for enterprise workloads.

### **4. Government Member Node**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard FSv2 Family**
- **Reason**: Government nodes may need high-speed processing for regulatory compliance and governance tasks. FSv2 instances offer high performance and scalability.

### **5. Financial Entity Member Node**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard NC Family**
- **Reason**: Financial nodes often handle complex transactions and require GPU acceleration for cryptographic operations. NC instances are ideal for such workloads.

### **6. Other Permissioned Member Nodes**
- **Recommended Instance**: **Standard DSv5 Family**
- **Reason**: Permissioned member nodes need balanced compute and memory resources for participating in the network. DSv5 instances provide flexibility and cost efficiency.

These recommendations are based on typical workload requirements for Hyperledger Besu nodes. Let me know if you'd like further details or assistance with deployment!
